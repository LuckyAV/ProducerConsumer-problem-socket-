## Producer-Consumer Problem
This project is part of the Mini Project for the course CSC411 - Integrative Programming Technologies at the University of Eswatini. 
The project aims to implement the classic Producer-Consumer Problem using a shared buffer and demonstrate concurrency, 
synchronization, and other aspects of multi-threading.

# Introduction
The Producer-Consumer Problem involves two types of threads, producers and consumers, that share a common fixed-size buffer. 
Producers generate data and add it to the buffer, while consumers remove data from the buffer and process it. The problem requires 
synchronization to avoid issues such as buffer overflow or underflow and to ensure that producers do not add data when the buffer 
is full, and consumers do not remove data when the buffer is empty.

# Implementation
The project will be implemented using C# programming language, and Visual Studio 2022 will be used as the development environment.

# Usage
To run the Producer-Consumer Problem implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the solution file ProducerConsumerProblem.sln in Visual Studio 2022.

3. Build the project to ensure there are no build errors.

4. Run the project, and the producer and consumer threads will start generating student data and processing it.
